                            <br/><br/>
                            The New South Books and UNSW Press websites are specialist book publishing, sales, marketing and distribution forces, owned by the University of New South Wales.
                            In 2018 we were contracted to migrate the UNSW press site to a new CMS (Wagtail) and in 2020 we were contracted to integrate a second website for NewSouth Books, their in-house agency. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Together, the websites host over 100,000 pages, store over 200,000 books and seamlessly manage complex relationships
                            between authors, publishers, prices, rights and inventories.
                            Data is ingested from multiple sources, transformed and stored, making
                            it easily editable by UNSW staff. A completely custom-built task-management system allows staff to set up and run scheduled tasks from
                            within the admin console. Additionally, we built a B2B dashboard for publishers that allows users to log in and run reports on their products.

                            <br/><br/>
                            In 2017, Neon Jungle was contracted to to develop a new website and claims system for Keystone Tasmania.    
                            The claims system is a custom portal that allows organisations to register, log in and lodge reimbursement claims for 
                            employees who have performed accredited training. The portal integrates with Keystone's accouting software (Xero) to then pay out the reimbursments.
                            <br/><br/>
                            The portal development involved close collaboration with Keystone to ensure that their standards and procedures are adhered to and that correct payments are being made.
                            The highly specific needs of this portal could only be achieved through custom software development, the end result was a system that has been in use daily since it's deployment, with 
                            a constant schedule of updates and new features, that is specifially tailored to the clients needs.

                            To celebrate their 100th birthday, Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania (RACT)
                            asked us to create a website that told the story of their rich history and
showcased how they've been helping
Tasmanians for an entire century. This project was a fun excuse to do some creative coding. We built a custom 3d model of the RACT logo that is animated using three.js as the user navigates through the timeline. The end result speaks for itself, this project was the Grand Diemen winner for digital in 2024
